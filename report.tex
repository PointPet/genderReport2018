	\section{Abstract}
In this paper our team focuses on the gender gap which appears in Science Technology Engineering Mathematics and Computer ,henceforth STEM, majors in university education. First of all we want to give an overview of the current situation of inscription rates in different STEM related majors at Johannes Kepler University Linz, from now on  JKU, and how the development progressed from 2002 to 2016 based on \cite{studienwahl_jku} \cite{eq_1} \cite{eq_2} \cite{eq_3}. After taking a close look at the situation in Austria we want to focus on reasons for the decision made when choosing a university major and what different influences people are committed.
In the next section the gender gap in STEM majors on universities in Germany is evaluated and compared against the situation in Austria. The main focus ,of the second part of this report, is to take a closer look at the international situation of the STEM gender gap. At the end of the report a conclusion of our findings will be presented.    
 	\section{Situation in German speaking countries}
	\subsection{Situation at JKU}
The study conducted in  \cite{eq_1}\cite{eq_2}\cite{eq_3}  showed that from 2005 throughout 2016 the share between man and women studying at JKU was not reflecting the demographic composition of Austria which would be 51\% women and 49\% of men studying at JKU. In 2005  the share between man and women studying at JKU was at a rate of  45\% but there is a slight increase since 2005 to 2016 where 49\% of all students at JKU were female students. If a closer look is taken at the inscription rates of new students, the rate of women starting at JKU in 2016, we see that the share of women is 53\%, which also represents the mean of female students of all Austrian universities. From the gender equality reports conducted from 2005 to 2016 it can be seen that JKU has a general problem in attracting women but the problem minimized during the past years. \newline\newline
After describing the general share of female and male students at JKU a closer look is now taken at the STEM related majors.
Unfortunately the data presented in \cite{eq_1}\cite{eq_2}\cite{eq_3} is inconsistent with each other meaning some data given in \cite{eq_1}can not be found in \cite{eq_2} and \cite{eq_3} or is structured in a different way. First we want to take a look at the statistics for the whole Technical faculty of Natural Science, hence TNF.\newline

\label{fig:dev}
\end{figure}
In figure number \ref{fig:dev} we can see the development of the STEM Gap at JKU's TNF over a period of 11 Years. If   a linear regression model is assigned to the data ,given by the equality reports, with 
\begin{equation}
y= \frac{7}{11}*x+21.4
\end{equation}  we see that the slight increase of female students at JKU fits the chosen model pretty well and this model might be useful for further estimates of the general decrease of the STEM Gender Gap.
If we take a closer look on the different STEM topics we notice that the STEM Gap is not found in all majors. In general it can be said that the share of male and female students in majors having a bio-science background   is dominated by female students. The share is about 63\% and keeps steady over the years. 
The highest gap which can be found at JKU is in Computer Science with only a share of 13\% female students. If the data of the equality reports is analyzed in further detail it can be seen that there is also no increase of female students in Computer Science since 2005. In the section \ref{theories} theories for the occurrence of the STEM Gender Gap in University Education, especially in Computer Science, will be presented.
\subsection {Differences between Master and Bachelor Studies}
Unfortunately the data given by \cite{eq_1}\cite{eq_2}\cite{eq_3} is inconsistent in this point. In \cite{eq_1}and in \cite{eq_2} only PHD studies are separated from its predecessors meaning further analysis between Bachelor and Master programs is not possible. In \cite{eq_3} the distinction between the different stages is available and shows that the share of women is slightly decreasing between Bachelor and Master studies. This comparison can be performed for all studies except for studies related to Bio-science since the data given in that section is not realistic (8/15 people in Bachelors program, 17/31 Masters program and 332/162 PHD program) and needs to be clarified with the authors of the report. 
\subsection{Situation in Germany}
After the situation at Johannes Kepler University was evaluated in detail we want to take a closer look at the STEM Gender Gap in University Education in Germany based on \cite{schneider}. The statistics show that the share between female and male students is similar to the share in Austria. In Mathematics and Science related studies female students hold a quota of about  37\% in Engineering and Computer Science Related topic the ratio drops to around 21\% female students in total. Studies performed by the German Government show that there is a constant increase of female students in STEM related studies since 1995. This constant increase can also be monitored in Austria as the graph in \ref{fig:dev} shows.\newline
The statistics mentioned in \cite{schneider} also mention that the drop out rate of male students is relatively higher for boys than for girls, meaning when women decide to study a STEM major the chances are higher they will stick with their choice than men. The ratio of drop out rates is in general high in STEM majors with 42\% of female students drop out rate and a drop out rate of 49\% for male students.
Another interesting finding is that the share of graduations for female students is rather high compared to the share of actual students in the related majors. In Mathematics 40.5\% of graduates are female but they only have a total share of 36.6\%  overall meaning that women also tend to finish their studies faster than their male colleagues.
\subsection{Theories for the STEM Gender Gap in University Education}
\label{theories}
After focusing on the statistical numbers at Universities in Austria and in German there is a need to take a closer look on the reasons for the STEM Gender Gap in University Education with a special focus on Computer Science since the STEM Gender Gap peaks in those majors.
In \cite{chan} a study with over 7000 high school student was conducted to find out if the degree of interest in the field of Computer science differs between young man and women. The study showed that those differences exist and that those differences in interest are also transferred to higher level education. \newline
In \cite{schneider} W. Schneider mentions that some aspects about STEM majors might discourage women. The most important factors are
\begin{itemize}
	\item Geek Factor
	\item Missing female role models
	\item Didactic of teaching personal
	\item Other influences 
\end{itemize}
The study conducted in \cite{chan} showed that the biggest turn off for female students deciding for a Computer Science Major is the so called ``Geek Factor''. Female students often tend to believe that a career in computer Science as a lifetime in an isolated office writing code. Most important when talking about the ``Geek factor'' is that it influences male and female students but has an higher influence on female students. 
Another problem is that programmers depicted in popular media like TV shows, news etc. are overwhelmingly male leading to an absence of female role models for future programmers.
In \cite{diff} the problematic of didactic in education is also mentioned having a negative influence for girls deciding to study a STEM major later on. Often STEM topics are taught in a ``Trial and Error'' manor. Meaning students try solving a task by simply trying out basic rules they learned or by adapting examples which are similar to the assigned task. This approach is often preferred by male students however female students tend to a heuristic learning approach where they first learn the rules and gain the back ground knowledge needed to solve the task before they try to solve the problem. \newline  
Other influences for example are that female students are often discouraged by their male colleagues and their achievements in STEM majors are not respected. Another example would be that female students tend to underestimate their knowledge already gained in Pre-University education.
