abstract="This paper presents results from a survey of Vancouver secondary school students on their interests and perceived abilities in a range of subjects, the factors they felt would influence their career choices, and a number of issues related to computer use and perceptions of computer professionals. Females indicated substantially lower interest and perceived ability than males in three subjects, namely computer science, engineering and physics. Females also reported spending less time on most forms of computer activities at school and at home, and gave lower estimates of their computer skills. The survey also revealed that both male and female students have little knowledge of the skills and personality characteristics needed for success in information technology careers. These findings may help explain the low participation of women in information technology areas in university and the work force.",
